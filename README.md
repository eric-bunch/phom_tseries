# Persistent homology for time series data in Python

This repo contains
- A presentation explaining the basics of persistent homology, as well as some applications to time series data
- A notebook containing examples using the [Dionysus](http://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus2/) and [Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser) libraries to compute Betti numbers for time series data using both Pandas and PySpark. The computations utilize the additions of the Pandas UDF functionality introduced in Spark 2.3.
